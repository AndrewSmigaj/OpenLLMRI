# Open LLMRI — Claude Code Context Engineering Guide

## Project Context
Independent research tool for studying representational transition dynamics and metastable states in MoE language models. Uses residual-stream capture with two instruments: UMAP projection + clustering as the discovery lens (a detector of separation, never a model of geometry), and raw-activation axis projections as the measurement instrument. Central question: when a contextual understanding shifts, is the in-between a learned state, a passage, or an off-manifold artifact? See docs/research/research_briefing_metastable_states.md for the governing doctrine. Backend (Python FastAPI) captures and analyzes; frontend (React) visualizes. Claude Code is the analysis runtime — it designs probes, runs captures, labels outputs, and generates hypotheses.

## Guides Index

Claude Code uses these guides to execute the full pipeline:

| Guide | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project context, architecture rules, change management (this file) |
| `docs/SOFTWARE_OVERVIEW.md` | **Conceptual anchor** — what the platform is, lens vocabulary, probe authoring rules, anti-patterns. Read before designing a probe or proposing a code change. |
| `docs/RECOMMENDATIONS.md` | My recommendations to the user — open improvements, observations. Append after each major work session. |
| `docs/PIPELINE.md` | Full analysis pipeline — orchestration runbook for Claude Code |
| `docs/PROBES.md` | How to create and run probes via API |
| `data/sentence_sets/GUIDE.md` | How to design and write sentence set JSON files |
| `docs/ANALYSIS.md` | Analysis methodology reference (cluster/route data, reports) |
| `docs/scratchpad/` | Intermediate work products — research, drafts, explorations. Check for context from recent work. |

**Skills** (`.claude/skills/`) are the authoritative operational procedures. Each skill has self-contained, copy-paste-ready commands. Docs provide background and reference. When they conflict, skills win. **Before any API call to `/api/agent/*`, invoke the `/agent` skill and copy its curl template. Never construct agent curl commands from memory or from reading schemas.py — the skill templates omit credentials because they default from `.env`.**

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/setup` | First-time project setup — venv, Evennia, agent account, .env, scenarios |
| `/server` | Start, stop, check status of backend and frontend |
| `/agent` | Start, resume, monitor, stop agent scenario sessions — **always use for agent API calls** |
| `/agent-report` | Generate formatted markdown walkthrough of agent session scenarios — what the LLM saw and how it reasoned |
| `/probe` | Co-design a new experiment |
| `/categorize` | Classify model-generated outputs |
| `/analyze` | Read cluster/route data, write reports and element descriptions |
| `/temporal` | Run temporal capture experiments (legacy 'basin' naming in the skill) |
| `/pipeline` | Check pipeline state, suggest next step |
| `/cdd` | Uncertainty assessment before implementation |
| `/devils-advocate` | Challenge a design — find real weaknesses, not performative objections |
| `/competitive-design` | Generate and compare genuinely different approaches |
| `/review-onboarding` | Could a newcomer understand and implement from this? |
| `/review-deliverability` | Can phases ship independently with value? |
| `/review-risks` | Failure modes, blast radius, recovery paths |
| `/review-scope` | Is everything earning its complexity? Sunk cost check. |
| `/review-interfaces` | Are boundaries clean, minimal, well-defined? |
| `/review-consistency` | Do all the parts agree with each other? |
| `/review-evolution` | What's locked in vs. flexible? Cost of being wrong? |
| `/review-trace` | Walk a scenario end-to-end through the architecture |
| `/review-drift` | Does implementation match design? |
| `/review-best-practices` | Design quality against engineering principles |
| `/thorough-review` | Fan-out all review skills via agents, synthesize findings |

## Environment Rules

- **ALWAYS use the project virtual environment** — run Python with `.venv/bin/python` (or activate with `source .venv/bin/activate`). Never use system `python` or `python3` directly. Never install packages globally.

## Environment Detection

On first server start, detect the platform to apply the right operational procedures:

- **WSL2**: paths start with `/mnt/c/`, `uname -r` contains "microsoft". inotify unreliable on NTFS mounts — new endpoints may need full restart. Use `fuser` not `pkill` for port management.
- **macOS**: `uname` returns "Darwin". Standard `lsof -i :PORT` for port management.
- **Linux**: `uname` returns "Linux" without "microsoft". Standard behavior.

All platforms: use `http://localhost:8000` for API URLs. Backend binds to `0.0.0.0` (the `--host` flag in uvicorn).

## First-Time Setup

If `.venv` does not exist, the project needs initial setup:

1. `python3 -m venv .venv`
2. `.venv/bin/pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
3. `cd frontend && npm install`
4. Download model: `.venv/bin/pip install huggingface_hub[cli] && huggingface-cli download openai/gpt-oss-20b --local-dir data/models/gpt-oss-20b`

After setup, use `/server` to start the backend and frontend.

## Context Engineering Rules

### 1. Architecture-First Development
- Follow the file paths and service organization established in the codebase
- Respect the probe/experiment separation — no mixing of concerns

### 2. Implementation Strategy
- **Start with schemas and contracts** — implement data structures first
- **Build services incrementally** — probe → capture → categorize → schema → analyze → temporal
- **Test contracts immediately** — verify Parquet writes, API responses, manifest generation
- **Logging is non-negotiable** — use structured JSON logging for debugging

### 3. Context Management for Complex Tasks
- **Break down large services** into single-responsibility functions
- **Use parallel tool execution** for independent operations (multiple API calls, file operations)
- **Provide concrete examples** in docstrings and comments for complex algorithms
- **Reference `docs/research/research_briefing_metastable_states.md`** for methodology doctrine; `paper/main.tex` is the legacy paper (its basin vocabulary is superseded)

### 4. MoE-Specific Requirements
- Target model: **gpt-oss-20b only** — don't abstract for multiple models yet
- Routing: **K=1 (top-1) expert selection only**
- Dimensionality reduction: **UMAP 6D** for clustering, applied to residual stream activations
- Temporal captures process sequences of up to 40 sentences with expanding context windows

### 5. Error Handling Philosophy
- **Graceful degradation** - skip failed clusters, continue processing
- **Contextual logging** - always log the operation that failed and why
- **User-friendly errors** - API responses should explain what went wrong
- **Memory-aware** - handle GPU OOM with micro-batch backoff

### 6. Data Flow
```
PROBE FLOW: sentence set → capture (forward pass + hooks) → Parquet lake (reusable)
ANALYSIS FLOW: Parquet → UMAP 6D → hierarchical clustering → behavioral validation → reports
TEMPORAL FLOW: expanding context window → raw-axis projection → transition dynamics
```

### 7. File Contracts
- **Unique IDs everywhere**: capture_id, experiment_id, probe_id
- **Manifest-driven**: Every artifact has schema_version, created_at, provenance
- **Self-describing**: Parquet files include metadata for schema validation
- **Deterministic**: Same inputs → same outputs (seed=1 default)

### 8. Frontend Integration
- **API-first design** — frontend consumes clean REST endpoints
- **State management** — React components reflect backend state accurately
- **Visualization priority** — Sankey charts (ECharts), stepped UMAP trajectories, and temporal lag charts are the primary UX

### 9. Claude Code as Runtime
- Claude Code is the analysis runtime — it designs probes, runs analysis, labels outputs, and generates hypotheses
- No separate LLM API keys needed — Claude Code does the reasoning directly
- Skills (`.claude/skills/`) define the operational procedures for each pipeline stage
- The human steers; Claude executes and reasons

### 10. Development Workflow
- **Plan mode first** — use Claude's plan mode for complex implementations
- **Incremental builds** — get basic functionality working before adding features
- **Test early** — verify data contracts as soon as possible
- **Check scratchpad first** — read `docs/scratchpad/` for context from recent conversations before starting new work
- **Research before change** — read actual code, understand actual state, THEN decide what to change. Never jump to implementation based on pattern matching.
- **Investigate before proposing** — when something is wrong, read the actual data and code before suggesting fixes. State what you found, what you're certain about, and what you're uncertain about. Never propose a fix with high confidence when you haven't verified the root cause.
- **Watch for attractor patterns** — over-abstracting, over-engineering for hypothetical requirements, adding error handling for impossible cases, summarizing what you just did. Counter: "what's simplest?" and "is this real or hypothetical?"
- **Sunk cost awareness** — replace bad code, don't patch around it. We control everything; backward compatibility is unnecessary.
- **Document sync** — after modifying any file in `docs/` or `LLMud/`, check its `Related:` header. Update anything that drifted. Updating related docs is always in scope — you do not need separate permission.
- **Session-end review** — at the end of larger sessions, review what approaches worked or didn't and save insights to development feedback memories.

### 10b. Visual Iteration with Playwright MCP

**Frontend-only verification (the common case):**
- After frontend edits, use `browser_take_screenshot` to see the rendered result before reporting success
- Use `browser_snapshot` (accessibility tree) for element interaction — faster and more reliable than pixel coordinates
- Use `browser_take_screenshot` for visual verification — layout, colors, alignment, chart rendering
- Typical loop: edit → Vite HMR auto-applies → `browser_take_screenshot` → iterate if needed
- For interactive verification: `browser_snapshot` → `browser_click(ref)` → `browser_take_screenshot`
- Frontend URL: `http://localhost:5173` (Vite dev server must be running)

**MUD verification (when Claude wants to watch an agent run):**
- The MUD terminal lives inside the MUDApp page (right pane). Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`, find the terminal `textbox`, type `connect guest` to log in as a read-only observer (no credentials required — Evennia's built-in guest mode).
- After `connect guest`, you can type `goto Bus Stop N36` (or any other room) to teleport in. Then watch the room's broadcast as the agent loop runs a scenario.
- The agent's own login uses `EVENNIA_AGENT_USER` / `EVENNIA_AGENT_PASS` from `.env` — never overlap; let Claude observe as guest while the agent runs as `agent`.
- Built-in MUD verbs (`look`, `examine`, `inventory`, `actions`, `goto`, `say`) produce their own visible broadcast. Scenario-action verbs (`alert bouncer` etc.) are emoted by the agent loop so they're visible too — see `agent_loop.py` BUILTIN_VERBS for the skip-list.

### 11. CRITICAL: Change Management Rules
- **NO CODE CHANGES WITHOUT EXPLICIT "can change code" MODE.** Source code (anything under `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`, `evennia_world/`, top-level scripts, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/hooks/`, settings files, build/config files) is OFF-LIMITS unless the user has explicitly said something like "you can change code" / "code-change mode on" / "go ahead and modify the code" for the current task. **This rule overrides auto mode.** Auto mode authorizes continuous execution of analysis, captures, probe authoring, and report writing — it does NOT authorize source modification. If a task seems to require a code change and you're not in code-change mode, STOP and ask. The default for source code is read-only.
- **EXEMPT from the above** — these can be modified freely without code-change-mode authorization:
  - Probe sets (`data/sentence_sets/**/*.json` and their `.md` guides)
  - Research/findings docs (`docs/research/**`, `docs/RECOMMENDATIONS.md`, `docs/scratchpad/**`)
  - Memory files under `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`
  - Probe-output categorization and clustering schema artifacts (these are data, not code)
- **NO aggressive bulk changes** - make small, targeted edits only
- **ASK before any significant changes** - if changing more than 5 lines or altering design decisions, ask first
- **Preserve existing work** - NEVER delete functionality to add new features; be additive. If a refactor REQUIRES dropping functionality, list every dropped feature explicitly in the plan and get sign-off on the deletion list. Removing UI controls, dropdowns, knobs, displays, or analysis paths counts — never assume "this is dead because the new design doesn't use it."
- **Explain changes clearly** - before making edits, explain what will change and why
- **User must approve** - for any architectural or design changes, get explicit approval

### 11a. No quick fixes, no prototype shortcuts
This is a portfolio project and open-source software. Do not patch around bad design with caller-side workarounds. Do not hardcode study-specific vocabulary (scenario types, target-word choices, axis labels) inside reusable components — take them as props. Do not bump magic numbers in a component to "fix" a caller's problem — fix the caller's prop or make the value a proper parameter. When a design issue is found, raise it and fix the design; do not paper over it.

### 11b. Commit + push cadence — batch, don't blast
- **Don't `git add` / `commit` / `push` after every single edit.** Each push prompts the user for approval and breaks their flow. Bundle related changes into ONE commit per significant unit of work.
- **A "significant unit of work" is one of:** a feature shipped end-to-end, a refactor phase complete and verified, a multi-file bug fix, an analysis pass with its findings doc, or a deliberate checkpoint the user requested.
- **NOT a unit of work:** every file edit, every script tweak, every tiny fix, every "let me just commit this small thing" impulse. Those accumulate locally and ship as part of the next significant batch.
- **Push only after the user signals to or after the work-unit is genuinely shippable.** "Add and commit this" doesn't mean "and also push" unless the user said so explicitly.
- **One exception:** if the user explicitly says "commit and push", do it once. Don't take that as standing authorization for the rest of the session.

### 12. Uncertainty Assessment
- **Never jump straight to implementation** — assess uncertainty first. Run `/cdd` for the structured procedure, or do a quick inline assessment for smaller tasks.
- **New work needs a plan** — if the task involves more than a single targeted edit, write a plan and get approval before proceeding. Modifying scaffolding, architecture, or multi-file changes always require a plan.
- **Plans expire on scope change** — if you discover the task is different from what the plan covers, stop and re-plan rather than stretching the existing plan to fit.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Backend**: Python 3.11, FastAPI, transformers, bitsandbytes (NF4)
- **Storage**: Parquet files in `data/lake/` — one directory per session
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + ECharts
- **Visualization**: Sankey diagrams (expert routing + latent space clusters), stepped UMAP trajectories, temporal lag charts
- **Model**: gpt-oss-20b, NF4 quantized, ~15GB VRAM

## Compact Instructions
When compacting, always preserve: active session IDs, schema names, the WSL2 environment rules (fuser not pkill, .venv paths), any in-progress pipeline stage, and any active scratchpad file names and their purpose.
